First, we will work through the simulation I discussed with you in class."

    "In many psychological settings, what we can directly observe is not what we are more generally interested in. For example, when we measure memory as the proportion of words that participants can recall from the list, this proportion is only a proxy for what we call \"memory strength\". We assume that memories in the mind differ continuously in their strength, and that you can recall a memory only if its strength passes a retrieval threshold. Thus, the proportion of correct recalls does tell us directly how strong memories are, but only how relatively strong they are to a threshold"
